## Project Description 
With COVID-19 becoming an ever-present threat in today's society, this app was designed to look-up the COVID-19 data of countries. It uses an open-source api (https://github.com/disease-sh/API) that provides detailed information on the virus and is constantly updated.

## User Stories
As a user, I canâ€¦
- Look-up the COVID-19 data of any country
- Create a user profile
- Manage vaccinations within user profile

## Technologies Used
MERN Stack
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js

## Stretch Goals
- Add user profiles in which vaccination records can be added
- Set reminders when to take next vaccine
- Add extra visuals (graphs, maps, etc.) 

## Issues

- Image cannot be made smaller
- Never linked the front- to backend
- Buttons don't link to anywhere
